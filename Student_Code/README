DOWNLOAD STUDENT DISTRO CODE INTO C9:
More comfy version: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChloeL19/CNN-pset/master/Student_Code/c9_more_comfy/student_more_comfy.zip
Less comfy version: 




Code files for students! (What they will ultimately download into their workspaces.)

Split into two categories: one for less comfy students and one for more comfy students

The folders with c9 in front are designed to work in the c9 environment.

The folders without this prefix will generate errors in c9, but will work nicely if you have something like the Spyder IDE
installed locally.
